# FlashFlood_Ecuador
Investigation on whether ecPoint-Rainfall can forecast flash floods in Ecuador.

NOTE: a "Data" directory is stored locally at ECMWF and it is not uploaded in GitHub because contains too many large files.
However, the data can be made available under request to Fatima Pillosu at fatima.pillosu@ecmwf.int.
